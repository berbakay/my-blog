This week’s blog is a little different. I was going to write something tech related but this felt more important.

I’ve had this overwhelming feeling over the last few years that I’ve already experienced all my favourite things. I’m in my late 20s soon to enter my 30s and how many people can say their favourite album is one released in their 30s? Whose favourite footballer is younger than them? I still enjoy music and football don’t get me wrong. New albums come out all the time that I enjoy. Some of my favourite bands are still very much active (check out The Menzingers, trust me). I still enjoy watching football. I still celebrate when United score. My weekends are still ruined when they lose but that sense of idolisation, I thought it had gone for ever.

Then came Marcus Rashford. 

In the space of 12 hours Marcus scored a last minute winning goal against one of the best teams in world football and the following morning he was on Twitter campaigning to deliver free meals to hungry children. The thing I love most about Marcus’ work is his refusal to get drawn into petty party politics. His praise of Conservative MP Anne Marie Morris highlights this perfectly. This isn’t about Labour v Conservative, Left v Right, this is about feeding hungry kids.

The pompous responses from some MPs have been deplorable and their arguments fall flat when faced with Marcus’ lived experience, his passion and his knowledge. 

I didn’t think I could love a footballer again. I can see them for what they are these days, young men who are getting to do what they love but are also flawed in their own ways. Rashford is different, he’s a great footballer and a great person doing a great thing. No doubt he’ll fall into some controversy at some point but deep down there’s no doubt he’s a great young man. I can unequivocally say I’m incredibly proud of him. I’m proud he’s British, I’m proud he’s from Manchester, I’m proud he represents my club. I just want to tell everyone everything about Marcus Rashford just like I did with my heroes when I was younger.

It feels good to have a hero again.

When I’m older, I’ll tell my kids and grandkids about my favourite players, my heroes growing up. I’ll tell them about Paul Scholes, Eric Cantona, Cristiano Ronaldo, Dimitar Berbatov. Above all, I’ll them about Marcus Rashford, MBE.

You can help Marcus in his quest to make sure every child in this country is fed by contacting your local MP or by donating money to https://fareshare.org.uk/donate/

I’ll write about tech again next week.

Rick.
