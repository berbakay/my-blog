Berbakay was live on Twitch!

Yep you read that right. Last Saturday I live-streamed on twitch for the first time. Twitch is something I’ve known about for years but never really understood. Whenever I went to check it out I either ended up watching a game I didn’t understand (like LoL or Fortnite) or the streamer would be loud and obnoxious (too many to name). 

I got into Twitch properly during lockdown and I find it to be perfect 2nd screen content. I’ve got it on right now, I’m watching Matt Staples play poker. I love poker but sometimes I can’t commit the hours it would take to run deep in a big tournament so it’s great to dip in and out watching someone else (much better than me) do it. I’ve also watched some Football Manager streamers (shout out to Dr Benjy & Soulja Boy (yep)) as I just don’t have the time to commit myself to the game at the moment. And of course I’ve watched (and played) a lot of Fall Guys. Fall Guys has been the perfect game to help me through lockdown, just pure uncynical joy, check it out if you haven’t already. Oh and also Mark Hoppus of blink-182 has been streaming a lot which has been great to watch. He live streamed an old video from blink’s self-titled album launch, it was great to reminisce about the good times with the man himself. 

This is really worth a watch if you’re interested https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND81RjA7CDg

Anyway, so after watching Twitch streams for almost 6 months, I decided to give it a go myself. I’m not playing any games at the moment so I decided to live stream some code. I’m currently building an API that will return a random Simpsons episode and I felt confident that I could get all the features implemented smoothly.

Things didn’t exactly go according to plan. I had to implement some functionality that I hadn’t done before. Without going into too much detail I had to make a request to three different SQL tables, manipulate that data so that it came back as a single object and then return it. Doing that on camera in a couple of hours was pretty stressful. In total I had 39 viewers with a peak of 7. I also managed to gain 2 followers which was awesome. If I can keep doubling my follower count every week then I should have a million by the end of the year. I was actually pretty pleased with the numbers considering my only advertisement was tweeting when the stream went live. In all honesty I was expecting 0 viewers. I had a chat with a couple of the viewers and luckily everyone was nice despite my struggles. One guy said ‘I can see that you are new but also that you are learning, good job’ which was a lovely thing to say…I think.

You can catch me on Twitch again every Saturday from 11am. I’ll keep streaming myself coding for the next few weeks until Football Manager 21 launches…..
