title:  "Am I a Developer?"

Wow. It’s been a hectic 10 weeks to say the least. I’ve gone from almost 0 coding knowledge to being able to build full back-end APIs with multiple restful endpoints. If you told me that 10 weeks ago I would have told you to pull the other one. I truly can’t believe how far I’ve come in a short space of time, it’s been unbelievably hard work but worth it all the same.  On top of that, some of the projects I have lined up are really exciting and I can’t wait to share them with the world.

The main question on my mind the last week or so has been *‘when will I stop being a trainee developer?’* I still have 6 weeks left on my course so I guess I’m still a trainee for now but how about when I graduate? Would it help my job prospects if I start calling myself just a *‘developer’?* I’ve spoken to a lot of different professional developers over the last few weeks and it’s clear that everyone feels these same doubts, alway questioning whether they are good enough to be given the titles that they have. They call it *‘imposter syndrome’* and while it’s a shame that some clearly very talented people feel that way, it’s somewhat comforting to know that almost everyone feels the same as I do.

I fell it the most whenever someone else is using a piece of software I have made. Knowing what’s going on in under the hood when someone clicks a button is pretty terrifying. I know about the questionable data manipulation that is happening behind-the-scenes and the feeling that it may all collapse like a house of cards if the user does something a little differently to how I tested it gives me massive anxiety. Will that feeling ever go away? Only time will tell, all I can do for now is test my software thoroughly and pray to the coding Gods.

**Apple News**

Those of you who know me know that I’m a bit of an Apple fan boy. So I thought I’d append some blogs with a bit of Apple news and my thoughts. Now is an especially exciting time with new iPhones on the horizon. I’m particularly excited as I’m still using my SE from 2016. 

The rumour of the iPhone Mini is music to my ears. As a fan of small screen phones the idea of a phone the size of the original SE with a full screen body and the latest internals sounds perfect to me. Apple also tends to follow the reasoning that bigger equals more expensive. If they keep up that thought process then my dream phone may also be the cheapest in the line up.

I believe the keynote will be in the next couple of weeks and I’ll be counting down the days as soon as we get the confirmed keynote date. I’m also excited to see what Apple do with the presentation now they can’t do it in front of an audience. We’ve had a small clue from WWDC and the iPad/Watch announcements but I wonder if they’ll go bigger with the iPhone…
